    description="Shortly after completing my education, I applied for my certificate
     and began a series of job applications. However, without any major results, 
     I’m now hearing back that most people are on their summer break. So, I think 
     I’ll follow suit and take some time to enjoy the summer while considering my 
     options for the future.

    description="This summer has brought a lot of rain and heat, which seems 
    to have resulted in an abundance of mushrooms and berries! The images show

    old fridge in the garage to store it all.
