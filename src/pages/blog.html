    description="After months of hard work, I’m thrilled to share that I’ve lost 20kg of my excess weight. When I approached 120kg, 
    I knew it was time for a change, and now I’m down to 97kg. My ultimate goal is to reach under 88kg before focusing on building 
    muscle. I’ll wait to share before-and-after photos until I reach my final goal."

    description="After considering my options, I believe I have decided on a plan of action for the upcoming job hunt.
    First, I will create a portfolio website to showcase my home projects and activities. Then, I applied to a few 
    interesting courses at Gothenburg University to acquire some valuable knowledge. However, until September most of my time will be dedicated 
    to preparing for the move to Gothenburg and attending to other matters that need my attention."

    description="With plenty of spare time, I asked my mother what she would like fixed at our house in the country. 
    After receiving a long list, I contemplated whether I had made a mistake, but I decided to tackle the most important tasks. 
    The picture shows the two balcony stairs, among other things, that I attempted to fix. It feels quite good to do some hands-on 
    work from time to time, especially when I usually spend so much time in front of a computer."

     I’ll follow suit and take some time to enjoy the summer while considering my
