      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        My programming career began after I realized that I wanted to work in a
        field I was passionate about, something that would make me excited to go
        to work every day. This decision led me to pursue an education in
        technology. I initially found the perfect blend of hardware and software
        in the

        program at Halmstad University to see which side of the coin I
        preferred. After two years, I discovered that my interests lay in
        software development, and I intended to switch to a computer science
        degree. However, when COVID-19 hit, I decided to stay an additional
        year, treating it as a siesta year and focusing on courses that piqued
        my interest.

        program at Linnéuniversitet. After three years, I graduated with a
        Bachelor's in Computer Science. Now, I’m actively seeking a job in the
        field while continuing to work on hobby projects and pursuing online
        certifications.

      <h3>Who I Am as a Programmer</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that most coding languages and frameworks can be learned
        within a reasonable timeframe by most individuals. So, what do I bring
        to the table that sets me apart?
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li>I pick up on complex ideas quickly and make sense of them.</li>
        <li>
          I can take unclear information and find patterns that lead to useful
          insights.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m good at figuring out the best ways to solve problems on my own.
        </li>
        <li>
          I’m creative and adaptable, always coming up with new ideas and
          solutions.
        </li>

        Besides my technical skills, I also have strong interpersonal abilities that are equally 
        important. I enjoy working with others, helping out with any problems, and stepping in 
        wherever needed. My teamwork and helpful nature make me a valuable member of any team.

      <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
      <p>
        When I’m not working, I enjoy staying active by going to the gym,
        wandering, and occasionally running. In addition to maintaining healthy
        habits, I like to dive into hobbies that catch my interest. Right now,
        it’s dancing, and maybe later on, a culinary course. My regular
        interests include gaming, reading, and playing guitar, and I’m always up
        for a drink and spending time with friends.
