    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Johan Lundmark, a passionate programmer with a Bachelor in
      Computer Science. I am quick at understanding complex material, finding
      solutions, and working collaboratively in teams. Outside of work, I spend
      my time in diverse interests and constantly work on imporving my skills.

      <h3>My Journey</h3>
      <p>
        My programming career began after I realized that I wanted to work in a
        field I was passionate about, something that would make me excited to go
        to work every day. This decision led me to pursue education in
        technology. I found the perfect blend of hardware and software in the
        "Master of Science in Intelligent Systems" program at Halmstad
        University. After two years, I discovered that my true passion lay in
        software development, and I intended to switch to a computer science
        degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, when COVID-19 hit, I decided to stay an additional year in my
        current program, treating it as a siesta year and focusing on courses
        that piqued my interest. The following year, I enrolled in the "Software
        Engineering" program at Linnéuniversitet. After three years, I graduated
        with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. Now, I’m actively seeking a job
        in the field while continuing to work on hobby projects and pursuing
        online certifications.

      <h3>Who I Am as a Programmer</h3>
      <p>
        I believe that most coding languages and frameworks are similar and can
        be learned within a reasonable timeframe. So, what do I bring to the
        table that sets me apart?
      </p>
      <ul class="value-list">
        <li>I quickly grasp and comprehend complex material.</li>
        <li>
          I can synthesize unclear information to spot patterns and draw broad
          conclusions.
        </li>
        <li>
          I independently choose effective problem-solving methods for tackling
          new projects or tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          I expertly use abstract thinking and adaptability to create new ideas
          and solutions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>These qualities are derived from "master value person" test.</p>
      <p>
        Beyond technical skills, I understand the importance of a cohesive team.
        I’m a social person who often takes on the problem-solver role within
        teams, always ready to assist others with their challenges. If there's a
        need for additional work in any area, I jump in and help wherever I can.
        I believe that my collaborative nature and willingness to support my
        team make me a valuable addition to any team I join.

      <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
      <p>
        I consider myself a multipotentialist or polymath, with interests
        spanning various fields. I've tried almost every activity you can think
        of, though the challenge is finding enough time for all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I’m not working, I like to stay active by going to the gym. I also
        rotate between hobbies; currently, I'm honing my guitar skills and
        looking forward to starting a dance program in the coming months. After
        that, who knows? I take life as it comes and aim to make the most of it.
        I also enjoy wandering, programming, gaming, and never turn down an
        invitation to have a drink and spend time with friends.
