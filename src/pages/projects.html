      <strong>Note:</strong> The next five projects were developed during my web
      development course and are not publicly available on GitHub to prevent
      academic misuse. If you'd like to review the code for a job interview,
      please contact me for access. Be aware that these projects relied on
      university servers, which were decommissioned after the course, so they
      may not function correctly.
